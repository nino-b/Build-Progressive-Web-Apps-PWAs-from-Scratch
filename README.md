# Web Authentication APIs

# Introduction

Welcome! This repository shows my journey through [Maximiliano Firtman's](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/firt/) [Build Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) from Scratch"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/pwas/) workshop. This workshop contains course resources, with the code I write along and my notes.

## About the Workshop

This workshop covers two main APIs: a web app manifest for installation and a service worker for offline. We see how to debug and test on real devices. Then learn how to distribute your apps through not only the browser but also native App Stores.


## Setup

Initial starting code for the course is on the `starting-code` branch.   
`git checkout starting-code` to get to the starting files.


## Giving Credit
